## Project Overview
This project utilizes Poisson distribution to predict the outcomes of Euro 2024 matches. The predictions include potential winners, scorelines, and winning percentages. The analysis is based on historical data and various statistical correlations. The results are compiled and visualized to offer insights into the tournament.
## Methodology
#### 1. Average Goals= Total Goals/ Total Matches
#### 2. Attack Rating= (Total Goals For/ Total Matches)/Average Goals
#### 3. Defence Rating=(Total Goals Against/ Total Matches)/ Average Goals
#### 4. Expected Goals= Xlookup  (Attack rating, Teams)* Xlookup(Defence Rating, Teams)*Average Goals
